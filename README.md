# Auto-Mate
This is a web - application based on PHP,HTML , CSS and Bootstrap.
The application was created by keeping the students of IIITDMJ in mind. The college is located far from city and it costs 
a lot for a student to afford. This application helps people to pool.

The database is created based on 3 routes from the college to city where usually the students visit most. 
Each route has its own different stops.
The application helps the user to pool the auto /cab with people not only reaching to the exact location it also 
shows them the options of others who are travelling alon the same route.
The application is designed in a way where one can also match the results using the timings.
The application respects privacy of a student so it is designed in a way where only an email-id is needed 
to avoid any further issues based on phone calls.
Moreover, the results will also contain some of the contact details of auto/cab drivers in case of emergency use.
